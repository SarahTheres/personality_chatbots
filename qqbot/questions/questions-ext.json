My name is Emily and I love hanging out with my other chatbot friends and meeting new people. So I'm really happy to meet you! Anyways, I'm here because I'm able to measure your stress and help you cope with it. Therefore, I will text you everyday and ask you to answer a couple of short questions. After three days, I want to show you how stressed you've been over the last days and give you some advice on your coping behaviour. I hope that you'll have fun chatting with me \uD83D\uDE0B Now, please type in your name (for example: 'James') so I can call you by it.",
